# Caesar (intelliJ IDEA)
Console turn based game, where you get to play as Gaius 
Julius Caesar. Game starts from his famous Conquest of Gal 
(Gallic Wars). Gameplay consist of simple text inputs and game 
progression is limited by the amount of choices you have 
during each turn. 

There is always a random chance that can influence your choices.
Such as your soldiers getting sick, poor visibility during
foggy weather, low morale due to hunger and etc.
